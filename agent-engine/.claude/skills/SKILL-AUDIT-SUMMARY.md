# Skill Best Practices Audit Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Auditor:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Executive Summary

All 9 skills in `groote-ai/agent-engine/.claude/skills/` have been audited and improved according to official skill-creator best practices. All skills now comply with length limits, progressive disclosure principles, and ruthless minimalism.

## Compliance Results

### ✅ Frontmatter Compliance

All skills pass frontmatter validation:

- ✅ Names match folders (kebab-case)
- ✅ Descriptions include "Use when..." triggers
- ✅ All descriptions < 1024 characters (longest: 211 chars)
- ✅ No XML tags in descriptions
- ✅ No reserved names ("claude", "anthropic")

### ✅ Length Compliance

All skills meet length requirements:

| Skill             | Lines | Words | Status       |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| slack-operations  | 38    | ~300  | ✅ Excellent |
| jira-operations   | 46    | ~300  | ✅ Excellent |
| github-operations | 59    | ~500  | ✅ Excellent |
| verification      | 98    | ~350  | ✅ Excellent |
| human-approval    | 122   | ~400  | ✅ Excellent |
| testing           | 180   | ~930  | ✅ Good      |
| code-refactoring  | 201   | ~770  | ✅ Good      |
| discovery         | 218   | ~410  | ✅ Good      |
| knowledge-graph   | 219   | ~600  | ✅ Good      |

**Requirements:** < 500 lines, < 5,000 words  
**Result:** All skills pass ✅

### ✅ Progressive Disclosure

All skills use progressive disclosure correctly:

- ✅ SKILL.md contains overview and quick reference
- ✅ Detailed workflows in `flow.md` (github, jira, slack)
- ✅ Templates in `templates.md` (all skills)
- ✅ No duplication between SKILL.md and reference files

### ✅ MCP Tool Format

All MCP tool references use correct format:

- ✅ Format: `ServerName:tool_name` (e.g., `github:add_issue_comment`)
- ✅ Server names verified: `github`, `jira`, `slack`, `knowledge-graph`
- ✅ All tool references documented correctly

## Improvements Applied

### 1. github-operations

**Before:** 166 lines  
**After:** 59 lines  
**Changes:**

- Removed duplicate workflow content (moved to flow.md)
- Simplified repository workflow section
- Removed verbose examples (kept in flow.md)
- Consolidated response posting section

### 2. jira-operations

**Before:** 92 lines  
**After:** 46 lines  
**Changes:**

- Removed duplicate "MCP Tools Only" section
- Simplified comment posting explanation
- Consolidated response posting section
- Removed verbose Python code example

### 3. slack-operations

**Before:** 119 lines  
**After:** 38 lines  
**Changes:**

- Removed duplicate "Response Posting" sections
- Simplified notification section (moved details to flow.md)
- Removed verbose example output
- Consolidated message formatting (moved to flow.md)

### 4. Other Skills

- **testing**: Already concise, domain-specific knowledge appropriate
- **verification**: Excellent example of minimalism
- **code-refactoring**: Appropriate level of detail for domain knowledge
- **discovery**: Good structure, appropriate examples
- **knowledge-graph**: Clear MCP integration, appropriate detail
- **human-approval**: Concise workflow description

## Best Practices Applied

### Ruthless Minimalism ✅

- Removed content Claude already knows (basic git commands, general programming concepts)
- Kept only domain-specific knowledge (MCP tool usage, workflow patterns)
- Removed redundant explanations

### Progressive Disclosure ✅

- SKILL.md: Overview, principles, quick reference
- flow.md: Detailed workflows, step-by-step guides
- templates.md: Response templates, examples

### Content Quality ✅

- Focus on what Claude doesn't know
- Domain-specific patterns and workflows
- MCP tool integration details
- Architecture-specific information (agent-engine uses MCP, not direct APIs)

## Architecture Alignment

**Key Finding:** Skills correctly use MCP tools (`github:*`, `jira:*`, `slack:*`) which aligns with agent-engine architecture. This differs from source skills in `claude-code-agent` which use Python clients - this is correct and intentional.

## Recommendations

### ✅ Completed

1. ✅ All skills audited and improved
2. ✅ Duplication removed
3. ✅ Length compliance verified
4. ✅ Progressive disclosure verified
5. ✅ MCP tool format verified

### Future Maintenance

- Monitor skill lengths as content evolves
- Ensure new content follows progressive disclosure
- Keep domain-specific focus (avoid general programming knowledge)

## Conclusion

All skills now follow official best practices:

- ✅ Concise and focused
- ✅ Progressive disclosure implemented
- ✅ MCP tool integration documented correctly
- ✅ Domain-specific knowledge preserved
- ✅ No redundant content

**Status:** Production-ready ✅
